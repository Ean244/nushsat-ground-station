COMMENTS
The abbreviation "IT" means "Insert To", it is the construction distance from the element tip to the edge of the boom for through boom mounting

Spacings measured centre to centre from previous element
Tolerance for element lengths is +/- 2 mm

Boom position is the mounting point for each element as measured from the rear of the boom and includes the 30 mm overhang.The total boom length is 883 mm including two overhangs of 30 mm

The beam's estimated 3dB beamwidth is 52 deg

A half wave 4:1 balun uses 0.66 velocity factor RG-8 (foam PE)  and is 226 mm long plus leads
FOLDED DIPOLE CONSTRUCTION
Measurements are taken from the inside of bends
Folded dipole length measured tip to tip = 325mm
Total rod length =680mm
Centre of rod=340mm
Distance BC=CD=145mm
Distance HI=GF=140mm
Distance HA=GE=167mm
Distance HB=GD=195mm
Distance HC=GC=340mm
Gap at HG=10mm
Bend diameter BI=DF=35mm

If the folded dipole is considered as a flat plane (see ARRL Antenna Handbook) then its resonant frequency is less than the flat plane algorithm's range of 10:1

MATERIALS GUIDE for purchase. Allow extra, do NOT use these figures for cutting
NO allowance for saw cuts or purchased lengths resulting in waste
1) Length used by directors and reflector 1743mm of round 8mm rod
2) Length used by single dipole 319mm or folded dipole 680mm of round 8mm rod
3) Length used for boom 883mm (allows for 30mm each end) round stock 15mm diameter
